### Clean code practices
Clean coding refers to writing code that is easy to read, understand, test, and maintain. 
The goal of clean coding is to create code that is not only functional but also well-structured, efficient, and easily understandable for both the coder and other developers who may need to work with the code in the future.

Some of the good practices are:

#### [1. Use consistent naming convention ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/theutsavg_clean-coding-practices-activity-7032041248408436736-4e5w/)

#### [2. Use well-defined functions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/theutsavg_use-well-defined-functions-activity-7035613194899394560-04T1)
